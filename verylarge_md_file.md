The Spring Championship of Online Poker - All Stakes (SCOOP) is an online poker tournament series sponsored by PokerStars. It was established in 2009.

Unlike the World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP), there are three different stakes in the SCOOP: Low, Medium - ten times the low stake - and High - 100 times the low stake.

SCOOP is also offered on PokerStars.it, PokerStars' site for Italian players. The Italian version of SCOOP features two levels: Low (€10 buy-in) and High (€100 buy-in), begins on May 30, 2010, and comprises 30 events (15 low and 15 high) with a combined guarantee of €2,000,000.

The Spring Championship of Online Poker - All Stakes (SCOOP) is an online poker tournament series sponsored by PokerStars. It was established in 2009.

Unlike the World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP), there are three different stakes in the SCOOP: Low, Medium - ten times the low stake - and High - 100 times the low stake.

SCOOP is also offered on PokerStars.it, PokerStars' site for Italian players. The Italian version of SCOOP features two levels: Low (€10 buy-in) and High (€100 buy-in), begins on May 30, 2010, and comprises 30 events (15 low and 15 high) with a combined guarantee of €2,000,000.

The Spring Championship of Online Poker - All Stakes (SCOOP) is an online poker tournament series sponsored by PokerStars. It was established in 2009.

Unlike the World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP), there are three different stakes in the SCOOP: Low, Medium - ten times the low stake - and High - 100 times the low stake.

SCOOP is also offered on PokerStars.it, PokerStars' site for Italian players. The Italian version of SCOOP features two levels: Low (€10 buy-in) and High (€100 buy-in), begins on May 30, 2010, and comprises 30 events (15 low and 15 high) with a combined guarantee of €2,000,000.

The Spring Championship of Online Poker - All Stakes (SCOOP) is an online poker tournament series sponsored by PokerStars. It was established in 2009.

Unlike the World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP), there are three different stakes in the SCOOP: Low, Medium - ten times the low stake - and High - 100 times the low stake.

SCOOP is also offered on PokerStars.it, PokerStars' site for Italian players. The Italian version of SCOOP features two levels: Low (€10 buy-in) and High (€100 buy-in), begins on May 30, 2010, and comprises 30 events (15 low and 15 high) with a combined guarantee of €2,000,000.
